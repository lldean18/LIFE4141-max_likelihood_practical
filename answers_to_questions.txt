1. One is to generate a model and one an independent dataset used to assess the model
2. 75%
3. supervised - unsupervised learning algorithms don't use a test set.
4. Petal length and petal width
5. Iris setosa
6. ~4.5-5.5cm length and 1.5-2.0 cm width
7. I reckon we've overfit because those angles probably don't describe a real pattern - we cannot tell without more data
8. versicolor
9. verginica
10. It's very simple. It only considers 2 variables. Clearly there is a zone of some overlap.
11. Increase K - this can be titrated and plotted to find the value of k that gives the best test accuracy. Training set accuracy will probably decrease with > K.
12. 0
13. virginica - left, left, right, left. Up Down all around
14. Right, Right, Left (false, false, true)
15. Petal length, Petal Width, Sepal length, Sepal Width
